# Introduction:
I-SpinSAGA live is a MATLAB application for the acquisition and analysis of HD-EMG signals that interfaces with SAGA, integrating the SAGA Interface for MATLAB. I-Spin offers the possibility to identify discharge activity of single motor units in real-time. It has the capability to use the learned motor unit filter in real-time, which opens up the possibility to supply subjects with visual feedback on the Motor Unit activity during experiments.

I-SpinSAGA is an adaptation from I-Spin live which has been developed by J. Rossato et al. (please cite https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88670.1 when you use the library for your experiments). More detailed information on the implementation and available procedures can be found on the GitHub page https://github.com/JulR14/I-SpinSAGA of I-SpinSAGA. Here, you can also find a step-by-step protocol that describes the application in detail.
