# Introduction:
I-spinSAGA live is a Matlab app to identify the discharge activity of single motor units in real-time and translate it into several forms of visual feedback. It is adapted from I-spin application (https://github.com/simonavrillon/I-Spin), of which it is a specific version for interfacing with a particular multichannel EMG recording system (i.e., SAGA 64+, EMG amplifier; TMSi, The Netherlands). Users can implement this tool during experiments requiring the control of the discharge activity of individual motor units or populations of motor units in real-time.

We provide here a step-by-step protocol (User manual.pdf) to facilitate the implementation of I-Spin live in any experimental settings. You can also read our preprint that describes the method, the main steps of the experiments, and the capability boundaries of the app (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88670.1).
